## Difficulties Encountered
- No indication as to how to generate the synthetic datasets.
  - It required tuning of the datasets in order to get the algorithm to display the behavior described in the paper
- Difficult to find implementations of all 11 algorithms with which PIC is compared in the paper
  - Had to implement some of them (LLM)
- FRGC-T is not available for public access and PubFig is no longer available at all.
- USPS does not have the number of samples indicated in the paper (9298 instead of 11000)
- Unclear preprocessing pipeline for Caltech-256's images.
  - Paper states that dimensionality is 4200, but not all images are of the same size
  - If a resize was used, its dimensions are not stated anywhere in the paper
    - Greyscale and 60x70 was assumed
